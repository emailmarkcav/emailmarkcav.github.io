Think. Do. Learn.

We all "think", we all "do", and we all "learn"...but how can we do all three better together for our business, our organizations, our projects, or our lives? I find this question to be interesting and complex. By leveraging technology, process, data, people, and timeless perspectives we can attempt to answer this question. 

This site be a collection of resources and projects including:

-Mental frameworks 

-Templates and playbooks of proven problem solving techniques (Six Sigma, DMAIC, Operations Research, Data Science, Machine Learning)

-Tools to accelerate learning

-Cheatsheets open-source technology (python programming, data storage, containerization, automation, data visuzalizations, machine learning libraries)

-Strategy and tactics for getting things done and communicating results

-Useful projects - applying above resources but designed for reuse and portability.
