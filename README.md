Think. Do. Learn. Be Useful. 

We all "think", we all "do", and we all "learn"...but how can we do all three better together for our business, our organizations, our projects, or our life? I find this question to be interesting and complex. By leveraging technology, process thinking, data, culture, and timeless perspectives we can attempt to answer this question... and be useful along the way.  

This site is a collection of resources and projects including:

-Mental frameworks 

-Templates and playbooks of proven problem solving techniques (Data Science, Machine Learning, Structured Problem-Solving, DMAIC approaches, and Operations Research Techniques).

-Tools to accelerate learning

-Cheatsheets for open-source technology (python programming, data storage, containerization, automation, data visuzalizations, machine learning libraries)

-Strategy and tactics for getting things done and communicating results

-Being Useful - applying above resources with designed for reuse and portability.

Let's go build useful things!
