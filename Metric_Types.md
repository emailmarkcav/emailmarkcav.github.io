Operations Teams all need metrics. Most the time teams have too many metrics. The key is to clearly understand objective of each metric and how it fits into overall metric strategy. Here is a framework I find useful over the years.

# Type of Metrics for Operation Teams
| **Metric Type** | **Objective** |**Examples**|
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Outcome Metrics**    | Measures desired state of value or behavior that will be generated  by product or service. | Investment can be large early on, but a well established and understood data foundation will scale for descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis.|
| **Control Metrics**    | Design to measure consistency, standardization, detect anomalies/exceptions, can we very actionable. | Starting with descriptive (BI) and automation use-cases can establish trust and drive productivity, but upskilling other teams/communities to handle that is a must to focus core resources on more advanced analytics.|
| **Compliance Metrics**    | Drive adoption, measure desired behavior | Establish trust as early as possible and challenge with "why?" first before getting into details on the "what?". Many teams want solutions without validating specific problem.|
| **Risk Metrics**    | Identifies potential issues or areas needing additional assessment.|Starting with executive metrics and mapping to operational metrics and even specific processes can become an asset for effective diagnostics|
| **Sentiment  Metrics**    |Perception, Feeling, can have spectrum of Responses, commonly qualitative, can be informative indicator of retention, loyalty, and growth.| With mature data foundation, context of domain, and strong understanding of "horizantal" impact up and down-stream of issue, this engagement is important to create top-down culture of being analytically-driven.
