title: Build a data science workbench!
---

Data science teams need an environment that allows them to work at scale (beyond their PCs). Luckly we are at point where most the data science tools are open source and can build our own workbench that can actually handle production level service if needed. (side note - We are starting to see a consolidation in the industry where data science offering are complete stack of technologies for maturing field of data science. 

# What are the technical tasks data scientist need to do anyways?
> Understanding domain, whats the problem statement, and impact of solution is absolutely critical, thats's another time
  #### Acquire data
  #### Store data
  #### Accesss, aggregate, transform data
  #### Automate data pipelines and scripts
  #### Visualize data and publish dashboards for consumption
  #### Identify key insights - variables, new features, interactions, and impact to response/desired outcome
  #### Train, test, validate M.L. Models
  #### Understand compute and HW limits
  #### Knowledge of effective containerization and VMs
  #### Document and present findings / storytell

> Above are the tasks needed to be successful, but regard different tools and technologies. 

# What are tools and technologies that can enable a data scientist to scale. 
#### Acquire data - python, APIs, SQL and NoSQL query languages
#### Store data - select right database technology, create/design tables, write data, and create data model for future
#### Access data from database - SQL and NoSQL query languages
#### Automate data pipepline - cron job, windows task scheduler, airflow
#### Visualize data - Tableau, Seaborn, Plotly, Spotfire, Excel, Google Data Studio
#### Identify key insights - explorative data analysis, summary statistics, distributions, model fitting, ANOVAs
#### Machine Learning Models - frame problem into response variable and select useful model (classification, regression, clustering, neutral networks, optimization), tensorflow, scikit-learn, caret 
#### Understand Compute and HW limits - GPU vs CPU
#### Containerization and VMs - docker, virtualbox
#### Document findings / storytell - powerpoint, github, markdown
