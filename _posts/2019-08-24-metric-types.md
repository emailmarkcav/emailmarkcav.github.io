Operations Teams all need metrics. Most the time teams have too many metrics. The key is to clearly understand objective of each metric and how it fits into overall metric strategy. Here is a framework I have built over the years.

# Type of Metrics for Operation Teams

| **Control Metrics**    | Design to measure consistency, standardization, detect anomalies/exceptions, can we very actionable. |  a.k.a process metrics. These should represent key control points in operation that needs to function effectively. The performance of identified control points should contribute to outcomes metrics|
| **Compliance Metrics**    | Drive adoption, measure desired behavior | Commonly used to change behavior or help with moving to new systems, tools, and processes.|
| **Risk Metrics**    | Identifies potential issues or areas needing additional assessment.||
