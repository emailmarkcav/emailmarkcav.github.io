title: Remove Waste, Enhance Experiences!
---

Generally speaking I remove waste, which in turn can enhance a wide range of experiences. Sounds simple. It actually can be simple, but don't confuse simple with easy. 

Layer 1 Waste - Visual waste which can be removed easily but over time it will return easily.

Layer 2 Waste - Unneccessary processes and tasks.

Layer 3 Waste - Neccessary but poorly designed processes and tasks

Layer 4 Waste - Needed well designed but manual process and task that can be automated

Layer 5 Waste - Automated process and task not adopted or utilized 

It's possible that traditionally defined waste can be reframed into value if your customer and/or market is well known. For example, think about going to the Airport and getting on a plane (sterile, designed for minimal waste) vs. going to Disney and going on rides (less sterile, design for experience). At a high-level these processes are very similar but optimize for different outcomes. This blog will attempt to provide useful tools to minimize waste, but maximize experiences (via open-source technology, data, analysis, and automation).  Let's have some fun.
