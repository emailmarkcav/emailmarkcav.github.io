title: Remove Waste, Enhance Experiences!
---

Generally speaking I remove waste, and enhance experiences for a living. Sounds agreeable, right? But where is waste, how do we define waste, what's the impact of waste, and if you remove all waste then are you making our experiences too sterile. For example, think about going to the Airport and getting on a plane (sterile, designed for minimal waste) vs. going to Disney and going on rides (less sterile, design for experience). At a high-level these processes are very similar but optimize for different outcomes. This blog will attempt to provide useful tools to minimize waste, but maximize experiences (via open-source technology, data, analysis, and automation).  Let's have some fun.
