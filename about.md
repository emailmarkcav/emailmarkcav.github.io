Think. Do. Learn. Be Useful. 

We all "think", we all "do", and we all "learn"...but how can we do all three better together to be useful (for our business, our organizations, our projects, or our life)? I find this question to be interesting and complex. By leveraging technology, system thinking, data, counter-culture mindesets, and under-rated (timeless) perspectives we can attempt to answer this question.  

This site is a collection of resources and projects including:

-Mental frameworks for problem solving and decision-making. 

-Templates and playbooks of proven problem solving techniques (Data Science, Machine Learning, Structured Problem-Solving, DMAIC approaches, and Operations Research Techniques).

-Tools to accelerate learning

-Cheatsheets for open-source technology (python programming, data storage, containerization, automation, data visuzalizations, machine learning libraries)

-Strategy and tactics for getting things done and communicating results

-Being Useful - applying above resources with user-focused design and intention of reuse and portability.

Let's go build useful things!
